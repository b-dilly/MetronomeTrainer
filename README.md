# MetronomeTrainer
This is a metronome app built in Unity Engine, but has a setting I couldn't find in any metronome app.

One of the best ways to build speed with playing an instrument is to play at a BPM you're comfortable with, then slowly increase the BPM until you can't keep up with it anymore. It was frustrating to stop playing so I could increase the BPM by 1 every minute. This metronome solves that issue by letting you start at a specific BPM and increase over time to a target BPM.
